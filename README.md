# UFOs Sightings - a Javascript Assignment


## Project Overview

The purpose of this project was to build a website based on data we received on UFO sightings in the form of a javascript array. Using javascript, we were able to create filtering options for different events based on the parameters that the user has entered. Furthermore, we used CSS to design our website and incorporate various fonts in our website. In this exercise, we were able to display tables on a website and create elements within HTML/JS to listen to user input events that would alter the way the UFO Sightings data was presented. 

## Results

Using a juxtaposition of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Javscript we created the following website in Github pages. **[UFO Sightings - The Truth is Out There](https://jeremysz0419.github.io/UFOs/)** 

Upon entering the page, we have encorporated an event listener on the top left header ("UFO Sightings") where clicking it will refresh the page and all the filters.

Furthermore a filtering section has been added which included five possible parameters (date, city, state, country, and shape). Additionally, you can filter either by entering just one of the parameters or all of them at once. This dynamic filtering system allows the user to have the freedom of easily filtering for the results and data they need.

## Summary

**Drawbacks:**

Some of the drawbacks of this website is the following:
1. The data we have received are not very reliable as they are outdated and not provided from a live source. 
2. The filtering system is case sensitive and thus users can easily miss data they need as the result will only return data specific to parameters with the same letter cases. 
3. Although there is a clicking event listener to refresh the page, the filtering system should need a button as well so that users can easily submit their filters. 

**Recommendations for further development:**

Recommendations moving forward are generally entities that can address some of the websites setbacks such as having a live source of data and an automation of updates to the data. Allowing the filtering system to be not case sensitive can allow users to easily search for all the data they need and adding a button can help users submit their filters. Furthermore, a change in design to the filters such as offering a dropdown where all the States are already listed can help users easily select their options.
